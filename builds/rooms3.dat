Ice Chamber
+
You shiver violently as you enter this room. Huge icicles 
line the ceiling. You might best hurry through this room
just in case one of them decides to break loose and fall...
On the floor is a thin layer of snow. There are exits to the 
west and south.

White Dragon Lair
+
You are in a huge jagged openning. Treasures, both wonderous and
horrible, litter the entire cave. You dare not touch them for its
owner may be near. There is an exit to the north.

Dead end?
+
You're in a small cave with one exit to the west. This place is
about exciting as watching paint dry...

except that there is exit to the east.

Quiet...too quiet...
+
Silence hangs over this room like a set of cheap drapes. This can't
be good. There are exits to the west and north.

Deadman Walking...

Smells of rotting meat in here. I'll spare you the rest of the details.
Trust me. You DON'T want to know. There is an exit to the south.

Gem Room
+
You are in a maze of twisty little passageways, all alike..........
just kidding!
You have emerged into a room made completely of precious jewels and 
metals. Don't get any ideas, though. You're only interested in one 
gem.

Chamber of Fates
+
You are standing in a room who's very existence seems to shift
every so often. The only things that seem to remain constant
are three small holes in the floor. You can barely make out
the words on a sign propped up on the far wall: "Return the
Sparkling Trinity to rise above all things". There are exits
to the north, west, and east.

Security Center

Wow! Considering where you are, you're taken completely aback 
by this room. Scores of VHS tapes line the walls in towering 
shelves. There's at least a few dozen monitors scattered about,
showing every nook and cranny of Limbo (odd since you saw no 
cameras on your journey). In the middle of the room is a VCR whose
clock is blinking 12:00AM. There seems to be a tape sticking 
halfway out of it...
