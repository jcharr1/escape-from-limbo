Ice Chamber
+
You shiver violently as you enter this room. Huge icicles 
line the ceiling. You might best hurry through this room
just in case one of them decides to break loose and fall...
On the floor is a thin layer of snow. There are exits to the 
west and south.

Gem Room

You are in a maze of twisty little passageways, all alike..........
just kidding!
You have emerged into a room made completely of precious jewels and 
metals. Don't get any ideas, though. You're only interested in one 
gem.

Chamber of Fates
+
You are standing in a room who's very existence seems to shift
every so often. The only things that seem to remain constant
are three small holes in the floor. You can barely make out
the words on a sign propped up on the far wall: "Return the
Sparkling Trinity to rise above all things". There are exits
to the north, west, and east.

Security Center
+
Wow! Considering where you are, you're taken completely aback 
by this room. Scores of VHS tapes line the walls in towering 
shelves. There's at least a few dozen monitors scattered about,
showing every nook and cranny of Limbo (odd since you saw no 
cameras on your journey). In the middle of the room is a VCR whose
clock is blinking 12:00AM. There seems to be a tape sticking 
halfway out of it...

Torture Chamber
+
You are in what appears to be a large torture chamber.  The walls are
lined with chains and shackles.  The most outstanding feature in the room 
is a large table in the center of the room, stained with blood.  Lying
across it is a huge axe. There are exits to the West, East and South.

Endless Pit
+
Careful!! As you peer into the room, you notice that it is nearly
perfectly round and the only walkspace is a narrow beam that stretches
between doors on the West and East walls.  Other than the narrow beam,
there is no floor that can be seen.  The beam seems to span a bottomless
pit.

+
This room is warm and has a dirt floor.  Growing everywhere are cactus and
thorny briars.  There are exits on the Nouth and East walls, but
traversing this room may be dificult.  You can hear the faint sound of
breathing.
